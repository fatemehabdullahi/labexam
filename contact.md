Jekyll is a great tool to create static sites, but thereâ€™s no backend to send your data to.

However, you can use free SaaS as a backend for forms, such as [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) to handle form submissions. Sleek has a configured form using formspree ready for you. All you have to do is change the email in `.config.yml`.

Check the form below to see it in action!

### Example Formspree contact form with validation and reCaptcha

Fill in the form or [email me](mailto:{{site.email}}) to discuss your next project.

{% include form.html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://mobinajafarpour.github.io">My Friend</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
